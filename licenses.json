The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Ex: dagre-d3-es version 7 depends on [d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3) version 7.\n\n## Demos\n\n[Simple graph demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/dagre-d3-es-tree-9ywg9) using react, dagre-d3-es, [d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3) version 7.2.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install dagre-d3-es --save\n```\n\n## Code example\n\nComing from the legacy `dagre-d3`, the main changes in your code will be:\n\n```\nimport * as dagreD3 from 'dagre-d3-es';\n...\nconst g = new dagreD3.graphlib.Graph().setGraph({});\n...\nconst zoom = d3.zoom().on('zoom', (zoomEvent) => {\n  inner.attr('transform', zoomEvent.transform);\n});\n\n```"

Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

If `true`, the container will be the parent element.\n\n### grid\n\n**Type:** _Array_\n\n**Values:** `[ x, y ]`\n\n``` js\ngrid: [ 20, 20 ]\n```\n\nSnaps the element to a grid, every x and y pixels.\n\n### handle\n\n**Type:** Selector _String_\n\n``` js\nhandle: '.handle'\n```\n\nSpecifies on what element the drag interaction starts.\n\n`handle` is useful for when you do not want all inner elements to be used for dragging, like inputs and forms. See [back handle example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/znAuH).\n\n## Events\n\nBind events with jQuery with standard jQuery event methods `.on()`, `.off()`, and `.one()`. Inside jQuery event listeners `this` refers to the Draggabilly element.\n\n``` js\n// jQuery\nfunction listener(/* parameters */) {\n  // get Draggabilly instance\n  var draggie = $(this).data('draggabilly');\n  console.log( 'eventName happened', draggie.position.x, draggie.position.y );\n}\n// bind event listener\n$draggable.on( 'eventName', listener );\n// unbind event listener\n$draggable.off( 'eventName', listener );\n// bind event listener to trigger once. note ONE not ON\n$draggable.one( 'eventName', function() {\n  console.log('eventName happened just once');\n});\n```\n\nBind events with vanilla JS with `.on()`, `.off()`, and `.once()` methods. Inside vanilla JS event listeners `this` refers to the Draggabilly instance.\n\n``` js\n// vanilla JS\nfunction listener(/* parameters */) {\n  console.log( 'eventName happened', this.position.x, this.position.y );\n}\n// bind event listener\ndraggie.on( 'eventName', listener );\n// unbind event listener\ndraggie.off( 'eventName', listener );\n// bind event listener to trigger once. note ONCE not ONE or ON\ndraggie.once( 'eventName', function() {\n  console.log('eventName happened just once');\n});\n```\n\n### dragStart\n\nTriggered when dragging starts and the element starts moving. Dragging starts after the user's pointer has moved a couple pixels to allow for clicks.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'dragStart', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'dragStart', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mousedown` or `touchstart` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n\n### dragMove\n\nTriggered when dragging moves.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'dragMove', function( event, pointer, moveVector ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'dragMove', function( event, pointer, moveVector ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mousemove` or `touchmove` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n+ `moveVector` **Type:** _Object_ - How far the pointer has moved from its start position `{ x: 20, y: -30 }`\n\n### dragEnd\n\nTriggered when dragging ends.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'dragEnd', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'dragEnd', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mouseup` or `touchend` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n\n### pointerDown\n\nTriggered when the user's pointer (mouse, touch, pointer) presses down.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'pointerDown', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'pointerDown', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mousedown` or `touchstart` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n\n### pointerMove\n\nTriggered when the user's pointer moves.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'pointerMove', function( event, pointer, moveVector ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'pointerMove', function( event, pointer, moveVector ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mousemove` or `touchmove` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n+ `moveVector` **Type:** _Object_ - How far the pointer has moved from its start position `{ x: 20, y: -30 }`\n\n### pointerUp\n\nTriggered when the user's pointer unpresses.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'pointerUp', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'pointerUp', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mouseup` or `touchend` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n\n### staticClick\n\nTriggered when the user's pointer is pressed and unpressed and has not moved enough to start dragging.\n\n`click` events are hard to detect with draggable UI, as they are triggered whenever a user drags. Draggabilly's staticClick event resolves this, as it is triggered when the user has not dragged.\n\n```js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.on( 'staticClick', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.on( 'staticClick', function( event, pointer ) {...})\n```\n\n+ `event` - **Type:** _Event_ - the original `mouseup` or `touchend` event\n+ `pointer` - **Type:** _MouseEvent_ or _Touch_ - the event object that has `.pageX` and `.pageY`\n\n## Methods\n\n### disable\n\n``` js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.draggabilly('disable')\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.disable()\n```\n\n### enable\n\n``` js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.draggabilly('enable')\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.enable()\n```\n\n### setPosition\n\n``` js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.draggabilly( 'setPosition', x, y )\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.setPosition( x, y )\n```\n\n+ `x` - **Type:** _Number_ - horizontal position\n+ `y` - **Type:** _Number_ - vertical position\n\n### destroy\n\n``` js\n// jQuery\n$draggable.draggabilly('destroy')\n// vanilla JS\ndraggie.destroy()\n```\n\n### jQuery.fn.data('draggabilly')\n\nGet the Draggabilly instance from a jQuery object. Draggabilly instances are useful to access Draggabilly properties.\n\n``` js\nvar draggie = $('.draggable').data('draggabilly')\n// access Draggabilly properties\nconsole.log( 'draggie at ' + draggie.position.x + ', ' + draggie.position.y )\n```\n\n## Properties\n\n### position\n\n``` js\ndraggie.position\n// => { x: 20, y: -30 }\n```\n\n+ `position` - **Type:** _Object_\n+ `x` - **Type:** _Number_\n+ `y` - **Type:** _Number_\n\n## Module loaders\n\n### Webpack & Browserify\n\nInstall [Draggabilly with npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/draggabilly).\n\n```\nnpm install draggabilly\n```\n\n``` js\nvar Draggabilly = require('draggabilly');\n\nvar draggie = new Draggabilly( '.draggable', {\n  // options\n});\n```\n\nTo use Draggabilly as a jQuery plugin, you need to install and call [jQuery Bridget](https://github.com/desandro/jquery-bridget).\n\n```\nnpm install jquery-bridget\n```\n\n``` js\nvar $ = require('jquery');\nvar jQueryBridget = require('jquery-bridget');\nvar Draggabilly = require('draggabilly');\n\n// make Draggabilly a jQuery plugin\njQueryBridget( 'draggabilly', Draggabilly, $ );\n// now you can use $().draggabilly()\n$('.draggable').draggabilly({...})\n```\n\n### RequireJS\n\nDraggabilly works with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org).\n\nYou can require `draggabilly.pkgd.js`..\n\n``` js\nrequirejs( [\n  'path/to/draggabilly.pkgd.js',\n], function( Draggabilly ) {\n  new Draggabilly( '.draggable', {...});\n});\n```\n\nTo use Draggabilly as a jQuery plugin with RequireJS and `draggabilly.pkgd.js`, you need to call jQuery Bridget.\n\n``` js\n// require the require function\nrequirejs( [ 'require', 'jquery', 'path/to/draggabilly.pkgd.js' ],\n  function( require, $, Draggabilly ) {\n    // require jquery-bridget, it's included in draggabilly.pkgd.js\n    require( [ 'jquery-bridget/jquery-bridget' ],\n    function( jQueryBridget ) {\n      // make Draggabilly a jQuery plugin\n      jQueryBridget( 'draggabilly', Draggabilly, $ );\n      // now you can use $().draggabilly()\n      $('.draggable').draggabilly({...})\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n\nOr, you can manage dependencies with a package manager like npm or Bower. Set `baseUrl` to the package directory and set a path config for all your application code.\n\n``` js\nrequirejs.config({\n  baseUrl: 'node_modules/',\n  paths: {\n    // path your your app\n    app: '../'\n  }\n});\n\nrequirejs( [\n  'draggabilly/draggabilly',\n  'app/my-component.js'\n], function( Draggabilly, myComp ) {\n  new Draggabilly( '.draggable', {...});\n});\n```\n\nTo use Draggabilly as a jQuery plugin with a package manager, you need install and to call [jQuery Bridget](https://github.com/desandro/jquery-bridget).\n\n``` js\nrequirejs.config({\n  baseUrl: 'node_modules/',\n  paths: {\n    jquery: 'jquery/dist/jquery'\n  }\n});\n\nrequirejs( [\n    'jquery',\n    'draggabilly/draggabilly',\n    'jquery-bridget/jquery-bridget'\n  ],\n  function( $, Draggabilly, jQueryBridget ) {\n    // make Draggabilly a jQuery plugin\n    jQueryBridget( 'draggabilly', Draggabilly, $ );\n    // now you can use $().draggabilly()\n    $('.draggable').draggabilly({...})\n});\n```\n\n## Browser support\n\nDraggabilly v2.2 supports Chrome 36+, Firefox 23+, Safari 9+ (mobile & desktop), IE10+, and Edge 12+.\n\nUse [Draggabilly v2.1](https://github.com/desandro/draggabilly/releases/tag/v2.1.1) for Android 4+ and Safari 6+ support.\n\nUse [Draggabilly v1](https://draggabilly.desandro.com/v1) for IE8 & 9, and Android 2.3+ support.\n\n## License\n\nDraggabilly is released under the [MIT License](https://desandro.mit-license.org/).

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n## 1. DEFINITIONS\n\n“Contribution” means:\n\n-   a\\) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n    Distributed under this Agreement, and\n-   b\\) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n    -   i\\) changes to the Program, and\n    -   ii\\) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n    “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n    behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the\n    Program that are not Modified Works.\n\n“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\nor Modified Works thereof.\n\n“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in\nany manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration files.\n\n“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version\n2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or\nadditional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.\n\n## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n-   a\\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n-   b\\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\n    under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\n    otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in\n    Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the\n    combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the\n    Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n    licensed hereunder.\n-   c\\) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to\n    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient\n    to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire\n    that license before distributing the Program.\n-   d\\) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n    license set forth in this Agreement.\n-   e\\) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor\n    makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in\n    this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program\n    under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of\n    Section 3).\n\n## 3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n-   a\\) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance\n    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a\n    statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this\n    Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable\n    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;\n    and\n-   b\\) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different\n    than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n    -   i\\) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n    -   ii\\) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental\n        and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n    -   iii\\) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the\n        Source Code under section 3.2; and\n    -   iv\\) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to\n        be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n-   a\\) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)\n    is combined with other material in a separate file or files made\n    available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor\n    attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this\n    Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of\n    such Secondary Licenses, and\n-   b\\) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n    the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n## 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\nContributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\nshould do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\nother Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\na commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial\nContributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\nContributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and\ncosts (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other\nlegal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\nProgram in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\nsection do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or\nalleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an\nIndemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\nContributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor\nin, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\nContributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n## 5. NO WARRANTY {#warranty}\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\nequipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n## 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY {#disclaimer}\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n## 7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\nto comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\nand does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\nbecoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\nthis Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\nof the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\nobligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\nrelating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\nonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\nthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this\nAgreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has\nthe right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the\ninitial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is\npublished, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including\nits Contributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\n## Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice {#exhibit-a}\n\n“This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”\n\n> Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is\n> not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n>\n> If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n> file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n> file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n> look for such a notice.\n>\n> You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership."

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\n\n- Isn't bloated\n- Has a simple Promise based API\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\n- Supports namespaces\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall Keyv.\n\n```\nnpm install --save keyv\n```\n\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\n\n```\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\n```\n\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\n// One of the following\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\nconst keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('etcd://localhost:2379');\n\n// Handle DB connection errors\nkeyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));\n\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true\nawait keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'\nawait keyv.delete('foo'); // true\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\n```\n\n### Namespaces\n\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\n\n```js\nconst users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });\nconst cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });\n\nawait users.set('foo', 'users'); // true\nawait cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true\nawait users.get('foo'); // 'users'\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\nawait users.get('foo'); // undefined\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\n```\n\n### Custom Serializers\n\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\n\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\n\n```js\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\n```\n\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\n\n## Official Storage Adapters\n\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\n\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\n---|---|---\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\n\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\n\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');\n\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\n```\n\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\n\n```js\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\n```\n\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');\n\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\n```\n\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\n\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \"Least Recently Used\" (LRU) cache\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\n\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\n\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\n\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\n\nInside your module:\n\n```js\nclass AwesomeModule {\n\tconstructor(opts) {\n\t\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\n\t\t\turi: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tnamespace: 'awesome-module'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow it can be consumed like this:\n\n```js\nconst AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');\n\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\n\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });\n\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\n```\n\n## Compression\n\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\n\n```js\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\n\n### Want to build your own? \n\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\n\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync serialize(value: any);\n\tasync deserialize(value: any);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\n\n```js\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require('@keyv/test-suite');\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\n\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\n```\n\n## API\n\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\n\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\n\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\n\n### uri\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThe connection string URI.\n\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\n\n### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\n\n#### options.namespace\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `'keyv'`\n\nNamespace for the current instance.\n\n#### options.ttl\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\n\n#### options.compression\n\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\n\n#### options.serialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\n\nA custom serialization function.\n\n#### options.deserialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\n\nA custom deserialization function.\n\n#### options.store\n\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\nDefault: `new Map()`\n\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\n\n#### options.adapter\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.\n\n### Instance\n\nKeys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.\n\n#### .set(key, value, [ttl])\n\nSet a value.\n\nBy default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true`.\n\n#### .get(key, [options])\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.\n\n##### options.raw\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.\n\nThis contains the TTL timestamp.\n\n#### .delete(key)\n\nDeletes an entry.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.\n\n#### .clear()\n\nDelete all entries in the current namespace.\n\nReturns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.\n\n#### .iterator()\n\nIterate over all entries of the current namespace.\n\nReturns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:\n\n```js\n// please note that the \"await\" keyword should be used here\nfor await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {\n  console.log(key, value);\n};\n```\n\n# How to Contribute\n\nIn this section of the documentation we will cover:\n\n1) How to set up this repository locally\n2) How to get started with running commands\n3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package requires the following dependencies to run:\n\n1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n\n## Setting up your workspace\n\nTo contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:\n\n1) Fork this repository into your Git account\n2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`\n3) Install any of the above missing dependencies\n\n## Launching the project\n\nOnce the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:\n\n1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.\n2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.\n3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.\n4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project's Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.\n\n## Available Commands\n\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\n\nHere, we'll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\n\n### `yarn`\n\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn bootstrap`\n\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn test:services:start`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project's Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project's Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn clean`\n\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nNow that you've set up your workspace, you're ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\n\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project's tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\n\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Jared Wray"

with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```js\nimport {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-space@1'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import

default export.\n\n### `factorySpace(…)`\n\nParse spaces and tabs.\n\nThere is no `nok` parameter:\n\n*   spaces in markdown are often optional, in which case this factory can be\n    used and `ok` will be switched to whether spaces were found or not\n*   one line ending or space can be detected with `markdownSpace(code)` right\n    before using `factorySpace`\n\n###### Examples\n\nWhere `␉` represents a tab (plus how much it expands) and `␠` represents a\nsingle space.\n\n```markdown\n␉\n␠␠␠␠\n␉␠\n```\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `effects` (`Effects`)\n    — context\n*   `ok` (`State`)\n    — state switched to when successful\n*   `type` (`string`)\n    — type (`' \\t'`)\n*   `max` (`number`, default: `Infinity`)\n    — max (exclusive)\n\n###### Returns\n\nStart state (`State`).\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports no additional types.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all

own micromark extensions.\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is [ESM only][esm].\nIn Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install micromark-factory-title\n```\n\nIn Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```js\nimport {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-title@1'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-title@1?bundle'\n</script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\n```js\nimport {factoryTitle} from 'micromark-factory-title'\nimport {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'\nimport {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'\n\n// A micromark tokenizer that uses the factory:\n/**\n * @this {TokenizeContext}\n * @type {Tokenizer}\n

the identifier [`factoryTitle`][api-factory-title].\nThere is no default export.\n\n### `factoryTitle(…)`\n\nParse titles.\n\n###### Examples\n\n```markdown\n\"a\"\n'b'\n(c)\n\"a\nb\"\n'a\n    b'\n(a\\)b)\n```\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `effects` (`Effects`)\n    — context\n*   `ok` (`State`)\n    — state switched to when successful\n*   `nok` (`State`)\n    — state switched to when unsuccessful\n*   `type` (`string`)\n    — type of the whole title (`\"a\"`, `'b'`, `(c)`)\n*   `markerType` (`string`)\n    — type for the markers (`\"`, `'`, `(`, and `)`)\n*   `stringType` (`string`)\n    — type for the value (`a`)\n\n###### Returns\n\nStart state (`State`).\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports no additional types.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained\nversions of Node.js.\nAs of now, that is Node.js 16+.\nOur projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nThis package works with `micromark` version 3+.\n\n## Security\n\nThis package is safe.\nSee [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to\nsubmit a security report.\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways\nto get started.\nSee [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.\n\nThis project has a [code of conduct][coc].\nBy interacting with this repository, organisation, or community you agree to\nabide by its terms.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus

1, index - open + 3, nextEvents)\n\n// …\n```\n\n## API\n\nThis module exports the identifiers [`push`][api-push]\nand [`splice`][api-splice].\nThere is no default export.\n\n### `push(list, items)`\n\nAppend `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).\nWhen `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.\n\nThis prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,\nand adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)\n    — list to operate on\n*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)\n    — items to add to `list`\n\n###### Returns\n\nEither `list` or `items` (`Array<unknown>`).\n\n### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`\n\nLike `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.\n\n`Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which\ncauses a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.\n\nOtherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an\narray instead of rest parameters.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)\n    — list to operate on\n*   `start` (`number`)\n    — index to remove/insert at (can be negative)\n*   `remove` (`number`)\n    — number of items to remove\n*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)\n    — items to inject into `list`\n\n###### Returns\n\nNothing (`void`).\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports no additional types.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained\nversions of Node.js.\nAs of now, that is Node.js 16+.\nOur projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nThis package works with `micromark` version 3+.\n\n## Security\n\nThis package is safe.\nSee [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to\nsubmit a security report.\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways\nto get started.\nSee [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.\n\nThis project has a [code of conduct][coc].\nBy interacting with this repository, organisation, or community you agree to\nabide by its terms.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\n\n<!-- Definitions -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://github.com/micromark/micromark/workflows/main/badge.svg\n\n[build]: https://github.com/micromark/micromark/actions\n\n[coverage-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/micromark/micromark.svg\n\n[coverage]: https://codecov.io/github/micromark/micromark\n\n[downloads-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/micromark-util-chunked.svg\n\n[downloads]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromark-util-chunked\n\n[bundle-size-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=minzipped%20size&query=$.size.compressedSize&url=https://deno.bundlejs.com/?q=micromark-util-chunked\n\n[bundle-size]: https://bundlejs.com/?q=micromark-util-chunked\n\n[sponsors-badge]: https://opencollective.com/unified/sponsors/badge.svg\n\n[backers-badge]: https://opencollective.com/unified/backers/badge.svg\n\n[opencollective]: https://opencollective.com/unified\n\n[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install\n\n[esm]: https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\n\n[esmsh]: https://esm.sh\n\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discussions-success.svg\n\n[chat]: https://github.com/micromark/micromark/discussions\n\n[license]: https://github.com/micromark/micromark/blob/main/license\n\n[author]: https://wooorm.com\n\n[health]: https://github.com/micromark/.github\n\n[securitymd]: https://github.com/micromark/.github/blob/main/security.md\n\n[contributing]: https://github.com/micromark/.github/blob/main/contributing.md\n\n[support]: https://github.com/micromark/.github/blob/main/support.md\n\n[coc]: https://github.com/micromark/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md\n\n[typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org\n\n[micromark]: https://github.com/micromark/micromark\n\n[api-push]: #pushlist-items\n\n[api-splice]: #splicelist-start-remove-items"

“block” tag names (`Array<string>`).\n\nThe list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition\n6\\).\nBecause they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be strictly\nparsed.\nFor tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used\nto detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.\n\nThis is copied from:\n<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.\n\n> 👉 **Note**: `search` was added in `CommonMark@0.31`.\n\n### `htmlRawNames`\n\nList of lowercase HTML “raw” tag names (`Array<string>`).\n\nThe list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in HTML that can include lines\nwithout exiting, until a closing tag also in this list is found (condition\n1\\).\n\nThis module is copied from:\n<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.\n\n> 👉 **Note**: `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports

[License](#license)\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis package exposes an algorithm to normalize identifiers found in markdown.\n\n## When should I use this?\n\nThis package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is [ESM only][esm].\nIn Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install micromark-util-normalize-identifier\n```\n\nIn Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```js\nimport {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1?bundle'\n</script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\n```js\nimport {normalizeIdentifier} from 'micromark-util-normalize-identifier'\n\nnormalizeIdentifier(' a ') // 'A'\nnormalizeIdentifier('a\\t\\r\\nb') // 'A B'\nnormalizeIdentifier('ТОЛПОЙ') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'\nnormalizeIdentifier('Толпой') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'\n```\n\n## API\n\nThis module exports the identifier\n[`normalizeIdentifier`][api-normalize-identifier].\nThere is no default export.\n\n### `normalizeIdentifier(value)`\n\nNormalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).\n\nCollapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.\n\nSome characters are considered “uppercase”, such as U+03F4 (`ϴ`), but if their\nlowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`θ`)) is uppercased will result in a different\nuppercase character (U+0398 (`Θ`)).\nSo, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.\n\nUsing uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default\nprototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of `Object`\nis uppercase.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `value` (`string`)\n    — identifier to normalize\n\n###### Returns\n\nNormalized identifier (`string`).\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports no additional types.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained\nversions of Node.js.\nAs of now, that is Node.js 16+.\nOur projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nThis package works with `micromark` version 3+.\n\n## Security\n\nThis package is safe.\nSee [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to\nsubmit a security report.\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways\nto get started.\nSee [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.\n\nThis project has a [code of conduct][coc].\nBy interacting with this repository, organisation, or community you agree to\nabide by its terms.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\n\n<!-- Definitions -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://github.com/micromark/micromark/workflows/main/badge.svg\n\n[build]:

utility to resolve subtokens.\n\n[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.\nThis is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,\nitalic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.\nInstead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings\nand closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.\nBecause media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation\nwhen one closing matches an opening, too.\n\n## Contents\n\n*   [What is this?](#what-is-this)\n*   [When should I use

character references (see\n[`micromark-util-encode`][micromark-util-encode]).\n\nA regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.\nFor example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or\n`/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).\nIf the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such\nas a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `url` (`string`)\n    — URI to sanitize\n*   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional)\n    — allowed protocols\n\n###### Returns\n\nSanitized URI (`string`).\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\nIt exports no additional types.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by

with markdown\n\nSee [§ Comparison][comparison] for more info\n\n## What is this?\n\n<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->\n\n`micromark` is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.\nIt’s implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens, so that every\nbyte is accounted for, with positional info.\nIt then compiles those tokens directly to HTML, but other tools can take the\ndata and for example build an AST which is easier to work with\n([`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown]).\n\nWhile most markdown parsers work towards compliancy with CommonMark (or GFM),\nthis project goes further by following how the reference parsers (`cmark`,\n`cmark-gfm`) work, which is confirmed with thousands of extra tests.\n\nOther than CommonMark and GFM, micromark also supports common extensions to\nmarkdown such as MDX, math, and frontmatter.\n\nThese npm packages have a sibling project in Rust:\n[`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].\n\n*   to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][cheat]\n*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]\n*   for updates, see [Twitter][]\n*   for questions, see [Discussions][chat]\n*   to help, see [contribute][] and [sponsor][] below\n\n## Install\n\n<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->\n\nThis package is [ESM only][esm].\nIn Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install micromark\n```\n\nIn Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle'\n</script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\n<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->\n\nTypical use (buffering):\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from 'micromark'\n\nconsole.log(micromark('## Hello, *world*!'))\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n<h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>\n```\n\nYou can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):\n\n```js\nimport {micromark} from 'micromark'\nimport {gfm, gfmHtml} from 'micromark-extension-gfm'\n\nconst value = '* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~'\n\nconst result = micromark(value, {\n  extensions: [gfm()],\n  htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]\n})\n\nconsole.log(result)\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> <a href=\"mailto:contact@example.com\">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nStreaming interface:\n\n```js\nimport {createReadStream} from 'node:fs'\nimport {stream} from 'micromark/stream'\n\ncreateReadStream('example.md')\n  .on('error', handleError)\n  .pipe(stream())\n  .pipe(process.stdout)\n\nfunction handleError(error) {\n  // Handle your error here!\n  throw error\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\n`micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and\n`micromark/stream`.\n\n`micromark` exports the identifier [`micromark`][api-micromark].\n`micromark/stream` exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].\nThere are no default exports.\n\nThe export map supports the [`development` condition][development].\nRun `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.\nWithout this condition, production code is loaded.\nSee [§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.\n\n### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`\n\nCompile markdown to HTML.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `value` (`string` or [`Buffer`][buffer])\n    — markdown to parse\n*   `encoding` (`string`, default: `'utf8'`)\n    — [character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when it’s a\n    `Buffer`\n*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)\n    — configuration\n\n###### Returns\n\nCompiled HTML (`string`).\n\n### `stream(options?)`\n\nCreate a duplex (readable and writable) stream.\n\nSome of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the\nend buffering is required.\n\nmicromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever\nstreams you pipe into it.\nAs markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)\n    — configuration\n\n###### Returns\n\nDuplex stream.\n\n### `Options`\n\nConfiguration (TypeScript type).\n\n##### Fields\n\n###### `allowDangerousHtml`\n\nWhether to allow (dangerous) HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).\n\nThe default is `false`, which still parses the HTML according to `CommonMark`\nbut shows the HTML as text instead of as elements.\n\nPass `true` for trusted content to get actual HTML elements.\nSee [§ Security][security].\n\n###### `allowDangerousProtocol`\n\nWhether to allow dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`, default:\n`false`).\n\nThe default is `false`, which drops URLs in links and images that use dangerous\nprotocols.\n\nPass `true` for trusted content to support all protocols.\n\nURLs that have no protocol (which means it’s relative to the current page, such\nas `./some/page.html`) and URLs that have a safe protocol (for images: `http`,\n`https`; for links: `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`, `xmpp`), are\nsafe.\nAll other URLs are dangerous and dropped.\nSee [§ Security][security].\n\n###### `defaultLineEnding`\n\nDefault line ending to use when compiling to HTML, for line endings not in\n`value` (`'\\r'`, `'\\n'`, or `'\\r\\n'`; default: first line ending or `'\\n'`).\n\nGenerally, `micromark` copies line endings (`\\r`, `\\n`, `\\r\\n`) in the markdown\ndocument over to the compiled HTML.\nIn some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are\nadded: `<blockquote>\\n<p>a</p>\\n</blockquote>`.\n\nTo create that line ending, the document is checked for the first line ending\nthat is used.\nIf there is no line ending, `defaultLineEnding` is used.\nIf that isn’t configured, `\\n` is used.\n\n###### `extensions`\n\nArray of syntax extensions (`Array<SyntaxExtension>`, default:

Originally based on\nthe [ng2-cookies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-cookies) library. The experienced team\nbehind [Studytube](https://www.studytube.nl/) will take care of our cookie service from now on.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install ngx-cookie-service --save\n\n# or\n\nyarn add ngx-cookie-service\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the cookie service to your `app.module.ts` as a provider:\n\n```typescript\nimport {CookieService} from 'ngx-cookie-service';\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n    providers:\n[CookieService],\n...\n})\n\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\n\nThen, import and inject it into a constructor:\n\n```typescript\nconstructor(private\ncookieService: CookieService\n)\n{\n  this.cookieService.set('Test', 'Hello World');\n  this.cookieValue = this.cookieService.get('Test');\n}\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n### Angular 14+\n\n1. Angular 14 introduced support for standalone components.\n   If you are using just standalone components, you can import the service directly into the component\n\n   ```typescript\n   import { CookieService } from 'ngx-cookie-service';\n   import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n   @Component({\n     selector: 'my-component',\n     template: `<h1>Hello World</h1>`,\n     providers: [CookieService],\n   })\n   export class HelloComponent {\n     constructor(private cookieService: CookieService) {\n       this.cookieService.set('Test', 'Hello World');\n       this.cookieValue = this.cookieService.get('Test');\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. You can also use `inject()` method in v14+ to inject the service into the component\n\n   ```typescript\n   import { CookieService } from 'ngx-cookie-service';\n   import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';\n\n   @Component({\n     selector: 'my-component',\n     template: `<h1>Hello World</h1>`,\n     providers: [CookieService],\n   })\n   export class HelloComponent {\n     cookieService = inject(CookieService);\n\n     constructor() {\n       this.cookieService.set('Test', 'Hello World');\n       this.cookieValue = this.cookieService.get('Test');\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Server Side Rendering\n\nNgx Cookie Service supports Server Side Rendering (SSR) via dedicated\nlibrary [ngx-cookie-service-ssr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-cookie-service-ssr).\nOnly install `ngx-cookie-service-ssr` library (and skip `ngx-cookie-service`) for SSR\n\n1. Install the library using below command\n\n   ```shell\n       npm install ngx-cookie-service-ssr --save\n\n       # or\n\n       yarn add ngx-cookie-service-ssr\n   ```\n\n2. By default, browser cookies are not\n   available in SSR because `document` object is not available. To overcome this, navigate to `server.ts` file in your\n   SSR\n   project, and replace the following code\n\n   ```typescript\n   server.get('*', (req, res) => {\n     res.render(indexHtml, { req, providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: req.baseUrl }] });\n   });\n   ```\n\nwith this\n\n```typescript\nserver.get('*', (req, res) => {\n  res.render(indexHtml, {\n    req,\n    providers: [\n      { provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: req.baseUrl },\n      { provide: 'REQUEST', useValue: req },\n      { provide: 'RESPONSE', useValue: res },\n    ],\n  });\n});\n```\n\n3. This will make sure the cookies are available in `REQUEST` object, and the `ngx-cookie-service-ssr` can\n   use `REQUEST.cookies` to access the\n   cookies in SSR. Then proceed to use `ngx-cookie-service` as usual.\n4. See the [sample repo](https://github.com/pavankjadda/angular-ssr-docker) for more details.\n\n## Demo\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-1lrgdt?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\n\n## Supported Versions\n\n`ViewEngine` support has been removed on 13.x.x. For Angular versions 13.x.x or later use the latest version of the\nlibrary. For versions <=12.x.x, use 12.0.3 version\n\n| Angular Version        | Supported Version |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 16.x.x                 | 16.x.x            |\n| 15.x.x                 | 15.x.x            |\n| 14.x.x                 | 14.x.x            |\n| 13.x.x                 | 13.x.x            |\n| <=12.x.x (View Engine) | 12.0.3            |\n\n# API\n\n## check( name: string ): boolean;\n\n```typescript\nconst cookieExists: boolean = cookieService.check('test');\n```\n\nChecks if a cookie with the given`name` can be accessed or found.\n\n## get( name: string ): string;\n\n```typescript\nconst value: string = cookieService.get('test');\n```\n\nGets the value of the cookie with the specified `name`.\n\n## getAll(): {};\n\n```typescript\nconst allCookies: {} = cookieService.getAll();\n```\n\nReturns a map of key-value pairs for cookies that can be accessed.\n\n## set( name: string, value: string, expires?: number | Date, path?: string, domain?: string, secure?: boolean, sameSite?: 'Lax' | 'Strict' | 'None' ): void;\n\n## set( name: string, value: string, options?: { expires?: number | Date, path?: string, domain?: string, secure?: boolean, sameSite?: 'Lax' | 'None' | 'Strict'}): void;\n\n```typescript\ncookieService.set('test', 'Hello World');\ncookieService.set('test', 'Hello World', { expires: 2, sameSite: 'Lax' });\n```\n\nSets a cookie with the specified `name` and `value`. It is good practice to specify a path. If you are unsure about the\npath value, use `'/'`. If no path or domain is explicitly defined, the current location is assumed. `sameSite` defaults\nto `Lax`.\n\n**Important:** For security reasons, it is not possible to define cookies for other domains. Browsers do not allow this.\nRead [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1063760) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17777005/1007003) StackOverflow\nanswer for a more in-depth explanation.\n\n**Important:** Browsers do not accept cookies flagged sameSite = 'None' if secure flag isn't set as well. CookieService\nwill override the secure flag to true if sameSite='None'.\n\n## delete( name: string, path?: string, domain?: string, secure?: boolean, sameSite: 'Lax' | 'None' | 'Strict' = 'Lax'): void;\n\n```typescript\ncookieService.delete('test');\n```\n\nDeletes a cookie with the specified `name`. It is best practice to always define a path. If you are unsure about the\npath value, use `'/'`.\n\n**Important:** For security reasons, it is not possible to delete cookies for other domains. Browsers do not allow this.\nRead [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1063760) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17777005/1007003) StackOverflow\nanswer for a more in-depth explanation.\n\n## deleteAll( path?: string, domain?: string, secure?: boolean, sameSite: 'Lax' | 'None' | 'Strict' = 'Lax' ): void;\n\n```typescript\ncookieService.deleteAll();\n```\n\nDeletes all cookies that can currently be accessed. It is best practice to always define a path. If you are unsure about\nthe path value, use `'/'`.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## General tips\n\nChecking out the following resources usually solves most of the problems people seem to have with this cookie service:\n\n- [article about cookies in general @MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) (recommended read!)\n- [common localhost problems @StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1134290/cookies-on-localhost-with-explicit-domain)\n- [problems with secure cookies @StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8064318/how-to-read-a-secure-cookie-using-javascript)\n- [how do browser cookie domains work? @StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1062963/how-do-browser-cookie-domains-work)\n- [get cookies from different paths](https://github.com/7leads/ngx-cookie-service/issues/7#issuecomment-351321518)\n\nThe following general steps are usually very helpful when debugging problems with this cookie service or cookies in\ngeneral:\n\n- check out if there are any [open](https://github.com/stevermeister/ngx-cookie-service/issues)\n  or [closed](https://github.com/stevermeister/ngx-cookie-service/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues that answer\n  your question\n- check out the actual value(s) of `document.cookie`\n- does it work if you use `document.cookie` manually (i.e. in a console of your choice)?\n- set explicit paths for your cookies\n- [explain to your local rubber duck why your code should work and why it (probably) does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)\n\n# I am always getting a \"token missing\" or \"no provider\" error.\n\nPackage managers are a well known source of frustration. If you have \"token missing\" or \"no provider\" errors, a simple\nre-installation of your node modules might suffice:\n\n```\nrm -rf node_modules\nyarn # or `npm install`\n```\n\n## I have a problem with framework X or library Y. What can I do?\n\nPlease be aware that we cannot help you with problems that are out of scope. For example, we cannot debug a Symfony or\nSpringboot application for you.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."
